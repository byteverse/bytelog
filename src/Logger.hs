-- | An output channel for logs. The intent is that there is only

-- all threads.
data Logger = Logger
  {-# UNPACK #-} !Fd
  -- ^ Output file descriptor, often stdout or stderr. Must be
  -- in nonblocking mode. This is checked when the logger is opened.
  {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
  -- ^ The number 1 if file descriptor is nonblocking. The number 0
  -- if it is blocking. Notably, stderr will almost certainly be in
  -- blocking mode.
  {-# UNPACK #-} !(MVar ())
  -- ^ Lock, only used when flushing.
  {-# UNPACK #-} !(IORef Chunks)
  -- ^ Chunks to be written out. This is only ever accessed by
  -- thread-safe atomicModify functions.
  {-# UNPACK #-} !(MutablePrimArray RealWorld Int)
  -- ^ Singleton array with a counter. This is used as a heuristic
  -- for when to flush. This is accessed in a non-thread-safe way
  -- where updates can be overridden. This is fine since logs will
  -- eventually get flushed anyway. Note that this is based on a
  -- number of units atomically written to the logger, not based
  -- on a byte count. Intuitively, it is deeply wrong to decide
  -- when to flush like this, but small-bytearray-builder is not
  -- able to provide the number of bytes that result from running
  -- a builder, so we use this hack instead.
